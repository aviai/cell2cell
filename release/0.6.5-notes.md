# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.6.5

## New features
- Implemented in-house GSEA using gseapy. Associated code is located in
 `cell2cell.datasets.gsea_data` and `cell2cell.external.gseapy`.
- Implemented a function to obtain a dataframe of lr pairs by cell pairs from a tensor decomposition
 result, so it can be use to make a plot. It can compute a communication score that is by factor or 
 across all factors. See function `cell2cell.analysis.tensor_downstream.get_lr_by_cell_pairs()`.

## Feature updates
- Added the axis names to the dataframe generated with ```cell2cell.analysis.tensor_downstream.get_joint_loadings()```,
 which correspond to the `dim1` and `dim2` parameters.
- Added the axis labels (`cm.ax_heatmap.set_xlabel()` & (`cm.ax_heatmap.set_ylabel()`) using the dataframe axis names
 passed to ```cell2cell.plotting.factor_plot.loading_clustermap()```
