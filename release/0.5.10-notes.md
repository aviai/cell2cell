# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.5.10

## Feature updates
In the analysis ```cell2cell.analysis.SingleCellInteractions.permute_cell_labels()```
the score computed without permutation is now considered as part of the permutation
distribution for computing P-values. So if 100 permutations are intended, the analysis
should be done with 99 permutation since the original score would be the 100th element.

## Fixed Bugs
- Fixed bug in ```cell2cell.plotting.tensor_plot.tensor_factors_plot_from_loadings()```
associated with the metadata when it was None.
- Fixed bug in ```cell2cell.plotting.tensor_plot.tensor_factors_plot_from_loadings()```
that was preventing to use a tensor with one dimension.
- ```cell2cell.plotting.factor_plot.context_boxplot()```
that was preventing to use a decomposition into just one factor.
- Fixed bug when using communication_score = 'expression_gmean' in cell2cell pipelines
