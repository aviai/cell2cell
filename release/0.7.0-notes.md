# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.7.0

## New features
- Added `cell2cell.spatial` functions for enabling analyses considering spatial organization in spatial data.
These functions include:
  - Filtering by intercellular distances by thresholding values (`cell2cell.spatial.distances` and `cell2cell.spatial.filtering`).
  - Dividing the tissue in square grids (`cell2cell.spatial.neighborhoods.create_spatial_grid()`)
  - Dividing the tissue in moving windows (`cell2cell.spatial.neighborhoods.create_moving_windows()`, `cell2cell.spatial.neighborhoods.calculate_window_size()`,
    and `cell2cell.spatial.neighborhoods.add_moving_window_info_to_adatae()`)

## Feature updates

 
## Fixed Bugs
- Fixed bug that made to incorrectly visualize multiple legends in plots as for example in `cell2cell.plotting.tensor_plot`
 when using newer matplotlib versions.
