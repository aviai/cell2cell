- Added the parameter ```var_ordered_factors``` in
 ```cell2cell.tensor.BaseTensor.compute_factorization()``` to decide whether reordering
 the factors by the variance they explain (in a descending order).
- Made the parameter ```normalize_loadings=True``` as default in
 ```cell2cell.tensor.BaseTensor.compute_factorization()```

## Fixed Bugs
