# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.6.3

## New features
- Created ```cell2cell.analysis.tensor_pipelines``` with functions to easily run
Tensor-cell2cell.

## Feature updates
- Deleted ```cell2cell.external.tensorly_nn_cp``` since it is not used anymore.
Tensorly is directly used instead.
- Renamed ```cell2cell.analysis.pipelines``` to ```cell2cell.analysis.cell2cell_pipelines```
- Added ```elbow_metric```, ```elbow_metric_mean``` and ```elbow_metric_raw``` attributes to ```cell2cell.tensor.tensor.BaseTensor```
for storing the curve generated from the elbow analysis.
- Removed parameter ```loc_zeros``` from ```cell2cell.tensor.tensor.PreBuiltTensor```
 
## Fixed Bugs
- Converted factors to numpy in ```cell2cell.tensor.factorization._multiple_runs_elbow_analysis()```
when ```metric='similarity'``` to avoid errors when using GPU.
- Fixed error obtained with functions ```sparsity_fraction()``` and ```missing_fraction()``` in a ```cell2cell.tensor.tensor.BaseTensor``` when
tensorly backend is different to numpy and the device is nto a CPU. This error was fixed with
making loc_nans and loc_zeros attributes of ```cell2cell.tensor.tensor.InteractionTensor``` and ```cell2cell.tensor.tensor.PreBuiltTensor```
to be now a tensorly.tensor object.
