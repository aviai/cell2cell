# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.6.3

## New features
- Created ```cell2cell.analysis.tensor_pipelines``` with functions to easily run
Tensor-cell2cell.

## Feature updates

Tensorly is directly used instead.
- Renamed ```cell2cell.analysis.pipelines``` to ```cell2cell.analysis.cell2cell_pipelines```
- Added ```elbow_metric_mean``` and ```elbow_metric_raw``` attributes to ```cell2cell.tensor.tensor.BaseTensor```
for storing the curve generated from the elbow analysis.
- Removed parameter ```loc_zeros``` from ```cell2cell.tensor.tensor.PreBuiltTensor```
