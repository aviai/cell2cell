# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.5.11

## New features
- Created a new function to use external communication scores, generated with other tools. This function can be found in
```cell2cell.tensor.external_scores.dataframes_to_tensor()```.
- Added multiple to options to aggregate gene expression of protein complexes. Available options are using the
minimum expression or the average expression among the subunits. This can be controlled with the parameter
```complex_agg_method='min'``` or ```complex_agg_method='mean'``` when creating a ```cell2cell.tensor.InteractionTensor```,
```cell2cell.core.InteractionSpace```, ```cell2cell.analysis.BulkInteractions``` pipeline, or ```cell2cell.analysis.SingleCellInteractions``` pipeline.
- The previous point relies on the function ```cell2cell.preprocessing.rnaseq.add_complexes_to_expression()``` through
the parameter ```agg_method='min'``` or ```agg_method='mean'```

## Feature updates
- Added two new options to the parameter ```how``` in ```cell2cell.tensor.build_context_ccc_tensor()```.
They are: ```how='outer_genes'``` and ```how='outer_cells'``` . These new options were also extended to all InteractionTensors
derived from ```cell2cell.tensor.tensor.BaseTensor```.
- These options of how were also extended to the new function ```cell2cell.tensor.external_scores.dataframes_to_tensor()```,
but here implemented as ```how='outer_lrs'``` and ```how='outer_cells'```.
 
## Fixed Bugs
- Renamed ```cell2cell.plotting.circos_plot``` into ```cell2cell.plotting.circular_plot``` to avoid incompatibility with
function ```cell2cell.plotting.circos_plot.circos_plot()``` that is directly imported under ```cell2cell.plotting```
