# Release Notes - cell2cell v0.6.4

## New features
- Added a the ```cell2cell.io.read_data.load_tensor()``` function to directly load a previously
 exported ```interaction_tensor``` variable generated with Tensor-cell2cell.
- Added a new dataset from a COVID-19 study. Available in ```cell2cell.datasets.anndata.balf_covid()```.
- Added functions to create and explore directories in ```cell2cell.io.directories```.
- Added ```cell2cell.io.read_data.load_tables_from_directory()``` to load all tables or dataframes with the same
extension that are located in such directory.

## Feature updates
- Modified ```sparsity_fraction()``` and ```missing_fraction()``` methods of ```cell2cell.tensor.tensor.BaseTensor``` to return
the item in the tensorly tensor object.
- Added progress bar to ```cell2cell.tensor.external_scores.dataframes_to_tensor()```.
- Added the option to specify the ```backend``` when running ```cell2cell.analysis.tensor_pipelines.run_tensor_cell2cell_pipeline()```.
 
## Fixed Bugs
- Implemented a way to manage duplicated instances of a LR comm score in ```cell2cell.tensor.external_scores.dataframes_to_tensor()```.
It can be controled through the parameter ```dup_aggregation```.
